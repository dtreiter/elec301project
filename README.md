RUNNING: Place any song you want to use in the "Music" directory. Now navigate to the "Preprocessing" directory. Open this directory in MATLAB (by opening and running main.m). Now call main('song_name') where song_name is the file name of the song you placed in "Music" (you do not have to type the .wav extension). Now open the "Visualizer.pde" file located in the "Visualizer" directory with Processing and run it.

EXAMPLE: To run the provided demo, open the Preprocessing directory in MATLAB and type main('demo'). Then open the "Visualizer.pde" file located in the "Visualizer" directory with Processing and run it.
